# 1853 Stockholm Cholera outbreak
This is part of research work on the history of Stockholm in the 19th century. Since Sweden has well-preserved church archives this permits getting detailed information about e.g. pandemic events
# Overview
Large Cholera Outbreak occurred in late August 1853 leading to About 3% of the population dying within a couple of weeks. Poor parts of the city, such as Saint Catherine Parish was struck. Only death records have been analyzed.

# Data Collection | Data sources
The data is collected from hand-written church records. The church was responsible for all population registration until around 1870.
All data can be found at the National Archive of Sweden. [Link](https://sok.riksarkivet.se/digitalaforskarsalen) 
Press "Other languages" for an English version.
Another important source for further analysis is "Sundhets-collegii underdåniga berättele om Kolerafarsoten i Sverge, 1853" which is a broad overview of the epidemic situation in all of Sweden. 
This contemporary report can be found at Statistics Sweden (SCB).
# Data Translation | Transformation
The data was translated using Google sheet, which is very effective for large dataset translation, then further transformation and visualization were done in Power BI Desktop.

# Insights
- Total deaths: A total of 283 persons died in Catherine Parish
- Death rate by gender: Female death was 52% while male death was 48%, More female death was recorded compared to male.
- Highest death rate was on Tuesdays and least death rate occurred on Sundays.
# Inspiration
I hope the data (and upcoming code/notebooks) can illustrate the speed of a cholera pandemic in the 19th 
century in an urban environment with very rudimentary sanitation, and related traumatic effects on society 
and individuals.
